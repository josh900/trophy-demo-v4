# AWS Hosting Options Similar to Vercel (2025-04-02 19:34:03)

_**User**_

I was hosting this on vercel but want to move it to aws. what is the best aws service to host it similar to vercel where i can just specify my repo and deploy it with the serverless functions

_**Assistant**_

<think>
Let's analyze the project to determine the best AWS service for hosting:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (static files)
   - Backend: Node.js serverless functions in the `/api` directory
   - Data fetching: Uses axios to fetch data from an external Budibase API

2. **Current Hosting**:
   - Vercel, which automatically handles static assets and serverless functions

For a similar experience to Vercel on AWS, you'd want:
- Automatic deployment from a GitHub repository
- Hosting of static assets
- Serverless function support
- Simple configuration

The most similar AWS service to Vercel would be AWS Amplify. Let's look at why and how it would work:

# AWS Amplify: Best Service for Vercel-like Hosting on AWS

AWS Amplify is the most comparable service to Vercel within the AWS ecosystem. It provides a simplified workflow for deploying and hosting web applications with serverless functions.

## Why AWS Amplify is Your Best Option

1. **Git-based Deployments** - Connect your repository (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab) for automated deployments
2. **Full-stack Support** - Handles both frontend (static files) and backend (serverless functions)
3. **Zero Configuration Deployments** - Detects your framework and builds it automatically
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Built-in continuous integration and deployment
5. **Branch-based Deployments** - Deploy different versions of your app based on branches

## How to Migrate Your Project to AWS Amplify

1. **Sign up for an AWS account** if you don't already have one

2. **Navigate to AWS Amplify Console** in the AWS Management Console

3. **Connect your repository**:
   - Select "Host web app"
   - Choose your Git provider (GitHub, etc.)
   - Authorize AWS Amplify to access your repository
   - Select the repository containing your project

4. **Configure build settings**:
   - Amplify will automatically detect your project type
   - Add the following `amplify.yml` to your repository:

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - npm install
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: /
    files:
      - '**/*'
  customHeaders:
    - pattern: '**'
      headers:
        - key: 'Cache-Control'
          value: 'max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate'
```

5. **Configure API routing**:
   - Create an `amplify.json` file in your repository root:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "routes": [
      {
        "path": "/api/*",
        "function": "api"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

6. **Set up your serverless functions**:
   - Create an `amplify/backend/function/api/src` directory
   - Move your API files to this directory
   - Add a handler file to route requests to the proper functions

7. **Set environment variables** in the Amplify Console for your API keys

## Alternative AWS Options

If you prefer more control or have specific requirements:

1. **AWS S3 + CloudFront + Lambda**: 
   - S3 for static hosting
   - CloudFront for CDN/HTTPS
   - Lambda for serverless functions
   - API Gateway to route API requests
   - More complex setup but gives granular control

2. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**:
   - PaaS solution for web applications
   - Supports Node.js applications
   - Less serverless-oriented but easier than raw EC2

3. **AWS App Runner**:
   - Fully managed service for containerized web apps
   - Good if you want to containerize your application

AWS Amplify remains the most streamlined option that closely matches Vercel's developer experience with minimal configuration changes to your existing project.
