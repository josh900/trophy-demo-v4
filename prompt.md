Functionality and structural changes:

remove text "Select a School" and add a card before the rest of the school cards that says "Browse Players". When clicked this should take the user to a list of all players.
duplicate players (i.e. same name) should combine into the same entry in the list.
Refine the player page so that instead of shoing the player details for the one sport, show the player with all sport info. i.e. if they are on multiple teams or sports show this in the players page. also show if the player went to D1 or pro. Additionally,show each of the player images, with a next/back button for switching between them. Show the statistics for each sport and with a header showing what the statiistics are for.
We want the player page to be unified so that all info is shown for the player, and the player page can be used anyewhere the player is listed.
Always show the current sport/team as the first data on the player page. i.e. if you get to the player page from Mens basketball 2025, then show the player image from Mens basketball 2025 individuals row, and have the first position and sport listed be Mens basketball 2025.


add search field next to the home button. 
this should return results of the teams or players, and upon selecting take the user to the related team or player/individual page.
